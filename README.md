# CAPM_Web-_Application
### Financial Analysis Project 
Conducted an in-depth analysis using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to evaluate the risk and return relationship of various assets within a portfolio. 

‚öôÔ∏è Tool : Python ,libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Plotly
üíª Frameworks : Streamlit
üóÇÔ∏è Source Dataset : Yahoo Finance

## Objective:
The objective of the project, was to assess the expected return and risk of individual assets.
This project showcases a web application that is designed to perform CAPM calculations for different stocks. The application uses Python programming language and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit and Plotly, to gather stock data from Yahoo Finance and perform calculations to determine expected returns.

## Data Collection and Processing:
Gathered historical data on asset returns and market returns. Ensured data integrity and reliability by employing robust data collection techniques and utilizing reputable financial databases.

## CAPM Calculation: 
Applied the CAPM formula to calculate the expected return for each asset based on its beta, risk-free rate, and market risk premium. This step involved meticulous calculation and thorough understanding of the CAPM framework.

## Risk Assessment: 
Analyzed the risk associated with each asset by interpreting their beta coefficients. Identified assets with higher betas as riskier investments and those with lower betas as relatively safer.
Beta
It is a measure of a stock's risk (volatility of returns) reflected by measuring the fluctuation of its price changes relative to the overall market.

√ü = 0: No Market Sensitivity
√ü < 1: Low Market Sensitivity
√ü = 1: Same as Market (Neutral)
√ü > 1: High Market Sensitivity
√ü < 0: Negative Market Sensitivity

## Portfolio Optimization:
Utilized the CAPM framework to optimize the portfolio composition by balancing risk and return. Employed modern portfolio theory principles to construct efficient portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return.
Sensitivity Analysis: Conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changes in key inputs such as the risk-free rate and market risk premium on the portfolio's expected return and risk profile.


## Presentation and Documentation: 
Prepared a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis methodology, findings, and recommendations. Presented the findings to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, highlighting actionable insights derived from the analysis.
